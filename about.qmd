Hello everyone! 
My name is Sameer Sapre and I am a Data Scientist with the Seattle Reign of the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) and was previously working in the analytics department of the Seattle Mariners.
I graduated from Penn State University in 2020 with a B.S. in Data Sciences and completed internships with Mars, Inc and Penn State's Applied Health and Performance Science department.
Outside of work, I'm the President of my [local Toastmasters chapter (please join!)](https://www.toastmasters.org/Find-a-Club/01417617-01417617), a youth soccer coach with Seattle Parks and Rec,
and a volunteer with Seattle Theatre Group.
